There was a lot to the homework so I separated it into 2 files.  I also ran out of time on the quiz because I think I thought you were looking for something more complicated for number 9.  I still worked through number 9 and 10 and those answers are included.  I also included my simple version of Lemonade Stand just for fun.  I got a little ahead of myself for the last question and created that, but ended up going back and making a simple function for the homework.
